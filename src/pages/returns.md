          Herbs, plants, roots, were commonly used before western
          pharmaceuticals were 

          introduced. Organic herbs like Blue Lotus, Kava, Cat's Claw, and 

          Ashwagandha Root are just a few that give our bodies multiple
          benefits 

          for internal health.
