  Concierge Customer Care

  The true origin of Cameron is unknown. One day we all met by chance and he 
  left such an imprint that he instantly was adopted into the family. His 
  exceptional interpersonal skills and likability coupled with an 
  extraordinary work ethic enable him to make everyone in the room feel 
  like he is talking right to them. With a background in beer brewing, he 
  seemed like the perfect fit to reach the younger generation and educate 
  them about the amazing flavors of feeling and dankness of all of the Sol
   Lotus products. We can't wait to see your order come through our 
  fulfillment team so that you have the chance to meet him.
