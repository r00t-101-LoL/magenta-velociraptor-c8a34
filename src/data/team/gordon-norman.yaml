  Sales or Product Testing or Something like that


  Nobody is really sure about the true origin of Cameron. He was such a likable
  guy that one day we all met by chance and he left such an imprint that he
  instantly was adopted into the family. His exception interpersonal skills and
  likability coupled with an extrodinary work ethic enable him to make every one
  in the room feel liike he is talking right to them. I think he was into
  brewing beer historically. Seemed like a good fit to reach the younger
  generation and educate them about the amazing flavors of feeling and, well.
  dankness of all the Sol Lotus products. Once you meet him, we can't wait to
  see your order come through our fullfilment team
