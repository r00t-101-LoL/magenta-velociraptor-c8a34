bio: |
  Co-Founder / C.O.O.

  Ashlee is one of the most valuable members on our team. With a background in
  merchandising, followed by many years as an Operations Executive in the
  banking industry, she is indispensable. Without her leadership and
  strict compliance, navigating the uncertainty of ancient traditional
  therapeutics and modern policy would have been near impossible. Her kind
  spirit and analytical thought process makes every interaction a
  pleasure. There's never been an issue where an employee or customer
  alike hasn't concluded with a feeling of appreciation and gratitude.
  Everyone always leaves her office with a smile on their face regardless
  of the difficulty to be addressed. When she agreed to co-found Sol
  Lotus, it became apparent that this was going to be a success. She
  brightens the room with her smile, never seems to miss a detail and
  ensures we remain on course for success.
