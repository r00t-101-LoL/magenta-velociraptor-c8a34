  Co-Founder / C.O.O.


  Ashlee is one of the most valuable members on our team. With a background in
  fashion merchandising followed by many years as an operations executive in the
  banking industry, she is indispensable. Without her leadership and strict
  compliance, navigating the uncertainty where ancient traditional theraputics
  and modern policy would have been near impossible. Her kind spirit and
  analytical thought process make every interaction a pleasure. There's never
  been an issue where employee or customer alike haven't concluded with a
  feeling of appreciation and gratitude. Everyone always leaves her office with
  a smile on their face regardless of the difficulty to be addressed. When she
  agreed to co-found Sol Lotus, it became apparent that this was going to be a
  success. She brightens the room with her smile, never seems to miss a detail
  and ensures we remain on course for success.
