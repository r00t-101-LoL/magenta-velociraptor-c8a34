    "bio": "Daniel has been a Technical Director in both marketing and banking for well over 10 years. His experience with the constantly changing world on digital marketing, design and technology blended with his passion for helping others have allowed him to quickly dominate every challenge we can throw at him. The word resilliant comes to mind very clearly. No matter how big the technical problem, he always seems to keep a heart felt smile on his face. We all have our own style, but Daniel steps it up a notch. If you happen to walk by one of our servers and see this seasons Gucci shoes under the rack, you've found him. Its because of his never ending desire to lift up others that we have weathered the trickiest technical storms. Only time will tell what's to come, but with an exceptional team dedicated to their cause, losing isn't in the agenda  \n",
