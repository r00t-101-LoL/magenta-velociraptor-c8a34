    "bio": "Technical Magician\n\nDaniel\n has been a Technical Director in both marketing and banking for well \nover 10 years. His experience with the constantly changing world of \ndigital marketing, design and technology, blended with his passion for \nhelping others, have allowed him to quickly dominate every challenge we \ncan throw at him. The word resilient comes to mind very clearly. No \nmatter how big the technical problem, he always seems to keep a \nheartfelt smile on his face. We all have our own style, but Daniel steps\n it up a notch. If you happen to walk by one of our servers and see this\n season's Gucci shoes under the rack, you've found him. It's because of \nhis never ending desire to lift up others that we have weathered the \ntrickiest technical storms. Only time will tell what's to come, but with\n an exceptional team dedicated to their cause, losing isn't in the \nagenda.\n",
