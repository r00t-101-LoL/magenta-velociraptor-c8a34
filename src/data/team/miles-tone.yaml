  Founder / CEO


  An Entrepenuer by every definition, Joshua began developing the core of Sol
  Lotus many years ago. Each challenge presented along the path delivered what
  felt to be impossible odds to beat, so the project was put on hold and others
  prioritized. With so many changes toward liberating individual freedom from
  the bindings of wester medicines, there could have been no better time. With a
  truly sincere desire to help others, the ability to bring the natural care
  that helped him and his loved ones for so many years to the public was tailor
  made. It's such an amazing time we live in where the ancient practices that
  sustained happieness, energy and longevity have a chance to emerge back into
  our daily practice
