  Founder / C.E.O.

  An Entrepenuer by every definition, Joshua began developing the core of 
  Sol Lotus many years ago. Each challenge presented along the path 
  delivered what felt to be impossible odds to beat, so the project was 
  put on hold and others prioritized. With so many changes toward 
  liberating individual freedom from the bindings of western medicines, 
  there could have been no better time. With a truly sincere desire to 
  help others, the ability to bring the natural care that helped him and 
  his loved ones for so many years to the public was tailor made. It's 
  such an amazing time we live in where the ancient practices that 
  sustained happiness, energy and longevity have a chance to emerge back 
  into our daily practice.
