  President of Treats


  With one of the most selective and refined palates in the Canine world, Dexter
  ensures that every production of of pet products beat the competition every
  time. He's a pup that knows what he wants and isn't afraid to tell you exactly
  what he thinks. He takes the role of inter species ambassador and quality
  assurance for his kind very seriously. In his 10 years, he's learned a lot of
  tricks and still picks up a new one every once and a while. When you watch
  your furry family member escape pain and anxiety and begin playing like they
  were just a puppy again, think of Dexter
