  Canine CBD Ambassador

  With one of the most selective and refined palates in the Canine world, 
  Dexter ensures that every production of pet products beats the 
  competition. He's a pup that knows what he wants and isn't afraid to 
  tell you exactly what he thinks. He takes the role of Inter Species 
  Ambassador and Quality Assurance for his kind very seriously. In his 10 
  years, he's learned a lot of tricks and still picks up a new one every 
  once and a while. When you watch your furry family member escape pain 
  and anxiety and begin playing like they were just a puppy again, think 
  of Dexter.
